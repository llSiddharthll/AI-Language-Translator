## Language Translation Algorithm

![Language Translation](pics/translation_image.jpeg)

> This repository contains an implementation of a machine learning algorithm for language translation between any two languages. The code utilizes a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an encoder-decoder architecture, implemented using PyTorch.

## Features

- üåê Translates sentences from one language to another using a machine learning model.
- üìö Supports parallel corpus training data for different language pairs.
- üß† Encoder-decoder architecture with recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- üîÄ Preprocessing steps including tokenization and vocabulary creation.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Training loop with batch processing and teacher forcing.
- üåç Example code provided for English-French translation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- TorchVision

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-translation-algorithm.git
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision
   ```

3. **Prepare the training dataset:**
   - Gather a parallel corpus of sentence pairs in the desired language pair.
   - Format the data as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an English sentence and its corresponding translation.
   - Replace the `data` variable in the code with your own dataset.

4. **Customize the hyperparameters:**
   - Modify the hyperparameters such as `hidden_size`, `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, and `num_epochs` in the main function to fit your requirements.

5. **Run the code:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Monitor the training process:**
   - The code will print the current epoch, step, and loss at each training iteration.

7. **Evaluate the translation quality:**
   - Use your own evaluation methods to assess the quality of the translated sentences.

8. **Save the trained model:**
   - The trained model will be saved as `translation_model.pt` in the current directory.
